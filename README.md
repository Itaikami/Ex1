Ex1 - Foundation of function programming & Testing
In this project as part of our computer science class we create some sort of calculator
to convert strings in the format <number>b<base> into an actual number and vice versa.
we also make basic calculation on them such as addition,comparison and multiplication.
if the user inserts a string that is not in the requested format it will restart the program until it receives 
a correct string.
